# Introduction

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and 
I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

# Shiny Apps

View my shiny app at [Jekyll](https://ajaykumar.shinyapps.io/shinyr_trends)
This is a **Shiny app** for working with bivariate analyses.
